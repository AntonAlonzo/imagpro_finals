# A License Plate Number Recognition System using Robinson's Compass Mask Edge Detection
IMAGPRO Guided Research Project | Alonzo, Hernandez, Solis, Susada

## Purpose of the Project
The objective of the project is to implement a simple system that utilizes edge detection to identify the edges of alphanumeric characters on a vehicle's license plate wherein the set of kernels is comprised of eight (8) unique directional masks. The performance of the system is to be measured in terms of the computational time of the edge detection algorithm and overall classification accuracy, and then the performance of widely used algorithms such as Canny edge detection is compared.
